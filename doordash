Case study
1:What are the areas where DoorDash can improve?
2:For example, if we receive frequent complaints about food getting cold, requiring refunds or credits for the entire order along with operating costs, how can we reduce these costs?
  spreak out the hypothesis
3:If there are some area we would proceed, they would like to know how to proceed. e.g. delivery time or whatever reasons we can improve, what is your approach to solving it?
4:If we need to conduct an experiment, how long would you run your A/B test for? How to design it?
5:You mentioned the minimum detectable effect and sample size; could you please walk me through how to determine those and how long we should run the experiment?
