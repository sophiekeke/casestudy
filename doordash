experiment/observational study:
Observation Study: regression model and set delivery time as factor and check the correlation with refund rate on food cold and find the threshold(>mean)
find control/treatment group(stratified and only difference is delivery time), and pull the historical data and find out whether they have difference in refund due to food cold(ratio)

Formulating Hypotheses

Null Hypothesis (H₀)

The null hypothesis states that there is no difference in the cold food refund rate between the control group (current delivery protocols) and the treatment group (improved delivery protocols). Mathematically, it can be expressed as:
H0:ptreatment=pcontrolH0​:ptreatment​=pcontrol​
where ptreatmentptreatment​ and pcontrolpcontrol​ are the refund rates for the treatment and control groups, respectively.
Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)

The alternative hypothesis asserts that there is a difference, specifically that the treatment results in a lower refund rate. This hypothesis is what you aim to prove through your experiment. It can be expressed as:
H1:ptreatment<pcontrolH1​:ptreatment​<pcontrol​
This is a one-sided test because you are only interested in whether the treatment group has a lower refund rate, not if it has a higher one.
Choosing the Confidence Level

The confidence level determines how sure you must be to reject the null hypothesis. Common practice is to use a 95% confidence level, which corresponds to an alpha value of 0.05. This means you are willing to accept a 5% chance of wrongly rejecting the null hypothesis (Type I error).
Running the Experiment

Once your hypotheses are set and your experimental design (including sample size) is established, you run the experiment according to the defined parameters. After collecting the data, you proceed with the evaluation.
Evaluating the Results
Statistical Test

To evaluate the results, you typically use a test suitable for comparing proportions, such as the chi-squared test or a Z-test for proportion difference. Here’s how you could set up a Z-test:

    Calculate the pooled proportion (combined rate of refunds from both groups), because under the null hypothesis, we assume the proportions are equal.
    Calculate the Z-score, which measures the difference between your observed statistic and the null hypothesis, scaled by the standard error of the statistic.

Decision Rule
If the p-value is less than 0.05, you reject the null hypothesis, concluding that the improved delivery protocol significantly reduces the refund rate due to cold food. If the p-value is greater than 0.05, you fail to reject the null hypothesis, indicating that the evidence is not strong enough to support a significant effect.

some idea:
1. Defining the Objective

The main objective is to reduce the number of refunds due to cold food deliveries. This can be achieved by decreasing delivery times, which is hypothesized to result in warmer food upon arrival and thus fewer refund requests.
2. Establishing the Minimum Detectable Effect (MDE)

First, you need to determine what would be a meaningful reduction in refunds. For instance, if current data shows that 5% of deliveries result in cold food refunds, even a 1% reduction (to 4% refund rate) might have significant financial implications. The choice of MDE should balance statistical significance and business impact.
3. Calculating the Baseline Metrics

You need to gather baseline data:

    Current refund rate due to cold food: Assume 5%
    Average delivery times: Assume 30 minutes
    Traffic and order volume: To determine sample sizes, know the average daily or weekly orders that meet the criteria for the study.

4. Calculating Sample Size

Assume you decide that detecting a 1% reduction in the refund rate is your MDE. Using a typical setup where alpha (error type I) = 0.05 and power = 0.8:

import scipy.stats as stats

# Desired alpha and power
alpha = 0.05
power = 0.8

# Z-scores for the desired alpha and power
z_alpha = stats.norm.ppf(1 - alpha/2)
z_beta = stats.norm.ppf(power)

# Baseline refund rate (p) and Minimum Detectable Effect (MDE)
p = 0.05
MDE = 0.01
# Sample size calculation formula
n = ((z_alpha + z_beta)**2 * 2 * p * (1 - p)) / (MDE**2)
n = round(n)
n

5. Determining Experiment Duration

Assuming DoorDash processes around 100,000 orders per week:
# Estimated weekly traffic
weekly_traffic = 100000

# Total sample size needed for both groups
total_sample_size = 2 * n

# Duration of the experiment in weeks
duration = total_sample_size / weekly_traffic
duration = round(duration, 2)
duration

6. Implementation Considerations

    Control vs. Treatment: You would have a control group with the standard delivery protocol and a treatment group where you implement strategies to reduce delivery times.
    Data Monitoring: Implement real-time monitoring to track the impact of reduced delivery times on refund rates.
    Adjustment for Variability: Consider external factors that might influence delivery times like weather or traffic, which may require adjustments in the analysis or extended experiment duration.

7. Statistical Analysis

Once the data is collected, you would use statistical tests to determine if the observed reduction in refund rates in the treatment group is statistically significant compared to the control group.


Designing an experiment to understand the impact of reduced delivery time on refund rates involves several key steps. Here's a structured approach to design the experiment and conduct the analysis:

    Define the Hypotheses:
        Null Hypothesis (H0): Reducing delivery time will not have a significant impact on the refund rate.
        Alternative Hypothesis (H1): Reducing delivery time will lead to a decrease in the refund rate.

    Identify Variables:
        Independent Variable: Delivery time (Reduced vs. Normal)
        Dependent Variable: Refund rate

    Experimental Design:
        Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT): Randomly assign a portion of customers to receive deliveries with reduced delivery times (experimental group), while the rest receive deliveries with normal delivery times (control group).

    Sample Size Determination:
        Calculate the required sample size based on statistical power analysis to ensure that the experiment can detect a meaningful difference in refund rates with sufficient confidence.

    Data Collection:
        Collect data on delivery times and refund rates for both the experimental and control groups over a defined period.
        Ensure that the data collection process is unbiased and representative of the target population.

    Define the Confidence Level:
        Choose a significance level (α), typically set at 0.05, which represents the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true.

    Conduct Analysis:
        Calculate the average refund rate for both the experimental and control groups.
        Perform statistical tests, such as a t-test or chi-square test, to determine if there is a significant difference in refund rates between the two groups.

    Interpret Results:
        If the p-value is less than the chosen significance level (α), reject the null hypothesis and conclude that reducing delivery time has a significant impact on the refund rate.
        If the p-value is greater than α, fail to reject the null hypothesis, indicating that there is not enough evidence to suggest that reducing delivery time affects the refund rate.

    Consider Practical Significance:
        Even if the results are statistically significant, consider the practical significance of the findings. Is the observed difference in refund rates large enough to warrant implementing changes to delivery times?

    Additional Analysis:
        Explore potential confounding variables, such as customer demographics or order types, that may influence the relationship between delivery time and refund rates.
        Conduct sensitivity analysis to assess the robustness of the findings to different assumptions or model specifications.

    Conclusion and Recommendations:
        Based on the analysis, draw conclusions about the impact of reducing delivery time on refund rates and provide recommendations to DoorDash based on the findings.

To calculate the sample size needed for comparing refund rates between two groups (control and experimental), we can use the formula for sample size estimation in a two-sample proportion test. The formula for calculating sample size in this scenario is:

n=(Zα/2×p1(1−p1)+Zβ×p2(1−p2))2(p1−p2)2n=(p1​−p2​)2(Zα/2​×p1​(1−p1​)
​+Zβ​×p2​(1−p2​)

​)2​

Where:

    nn = sample size per group
    Zα/2Zα/2​ = Z-score corresponding to the desired level of significance (α)
    ZβZβ​ = Z-score corresponding to the desired power (1-β)
    p1p1​ = estimated proportion of refunds in the control group
    p2p2​ = estimated proportion of refunds in the experimental group

Given:

    Current refund rate (p1) = 5% = 0.05
    Improved refund rate (p2) = 2% = 0.02
    Desired level of significance (α) = 0.05 (corresponding to a 95% confidence level)
    Desired power (1-β) = Typically set at 0.80 or 0.90 for a power of 80% or 90% respectively. Let's use 0.80 for this example.

We also need to find the corresponding Z-scores for the chosen level of significance and power. For a 95% confidence level, Zα/2Zα/2​ is approximately 1.96. For a power of 0.80, ZβZβ​ is approximately 0.84.

Substitute these values into the formula:

n=(1.96×0.05(1−0.05)+0.84×0.02(1−0.02))2(0.05−0.02)2n=(0.05−0.02)2(1.96×0.05(1−0.05)
​+0.84×0.02(1−0.02)

​)2​

n=(1.96×0.05(0.95)+0.84×0.02(0.98))2(0.03)2n=(0.03)2(1.96×0.05(0.95)
​+0.84×0.02(0.98)

​)2​

n=(1.96×0.218+0.84×0.14)20.032n=0.032(1.96×0.218+0.84×0.14)2​

n=(0.427+0.117)20.032n=0.032(0.427+0.117)2​

n=(0.544)20.0009n=0.0009(0.544)2​

n≈0.295840.0009n≈0.00090.29584​

n≈328.71n≈328.71

Since you cannot have a fraction of a person, you would need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the calculated sample size per group is approximately 329. Therefore, you would need a total sample size of 329×2=658329×2=658 customers (329 in each group) to detect a significant difference between the refund rates with 80% power and 95% confidence level.
